Directory layout is explained here
http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html

'after' is the standard runtime directory layout, but all overrides
'plugged' is for installed [n]vim plugins via the vim-plug framework
'usr' holds all of my custom stuff that doesn't fit into any folder under 'after'
