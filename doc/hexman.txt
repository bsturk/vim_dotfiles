Hexmanger provides keymapping to view quickly your file 
in hexmode (convertion is done over the program xxd). 
                                                               
Additional features: 
- shows in statusline the current offset (hex and dec.) 
- move to next/previous hex character with <TAB> and <S-TAB> 
  If you don't like this mapping - please set in your vimrc: 
  let hex_movetab = 0 
- staying on a hex character it marks the related ascii column 
- Goto hex offset    
- Delete hex character under cursor    
- Insert ascii character before cursor

If you want, you can change the mapping in your vimrc: 
Example (call with function key F6 the Hexmode:

Normally, this file should reside in the plugins 
directory and be automatically sourced. If not, you must 
manually source this file using ':source hexman.vim'. 
                                                             
If you want to edit a file in hexmode, start vim 
with the -b option - like: 
      vim -b <file> 
and then switch to hexmode with <leader>hm 
(see Available functions). 
The program xxd is needed to convert the file in hex (and 
back). 
Only changes in the hex part are used.   
Changes in the printable text part on the right are ignored.
