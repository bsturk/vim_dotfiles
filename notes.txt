For nvim to work w/ my config, there needs to be a symlink called ~/.vim/init.vim that points to ~/.vim/.vimrc and also a symlink from ~/.config/nvim to ~/.vim

I use the lazy package manager
https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim, see ~/.vim/usr/init.lua
plugins I use are listed in ~/.vim/lua/plugins.lua
plugins are installed to ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy

image.vim is not done by packer as it has local changes

my LSP settings in ~/.vim/lua/lsp.lua
